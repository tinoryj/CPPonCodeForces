[949B - A Leapfrog in the Array](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/949/B)
## 思路

n的规律
n=1 1
n=2 1 2
n=3 1 3 2
n=4 1 3 2 4
n=5 1 5 2 4 3
n=6 1 4 2 6 3 5
n=7 1 6 2 5 3 7 4
n=8 1 5 2 7 3 6 4 8

查找奇数: i/2+1

查找偶数:

以n = 5为例

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  | 2 |  | 3 |  | 4 |  | 5 |


| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  | 2 |  | 3 |  | 4 | 5 |  |


| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  | 2 |  | 3 | 5 | 4 |  |  |


| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  | 2 | 4 | 3 | 5 |  |  |  |

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 |  5 | 2 | 4 | 3 |  |  |  |  |


i = 2 时 结果为5

| 位置 | 移动格数 | 
| --- | --- |
| 9 | 0 |
| 8 | 1 | 
| 6 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 | 

奇数时: i / 2 + 1

6 - 2 = n - 2/2
8 - 6 = n - 6/2
9 - 8 = n - 8/2

偶数时:
递推 $i_{k}$ += (n-$i_{k-1}$/2)
得到未移动前的位置 - 变成了奇数.     
得到所有结果

## 代码

```
#include<cstdio>  
#include<cstring>  
#include<algorithm>

using namespace std;  

long long n,m;  

int main(){  
 
    scanf("%I64d%I64d",&n,&m);  
    while(m--){  
        long long x;  
        scanf("%I64d",&x);  
        while(x%2==0)  
            x+=(n-x/2);  
        printf("%I64d\n",x/2+1);  
    }  
    return 0;  
} 
```
